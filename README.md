Title: Bubblesort program

This C program implements a multipurpose bubble sort that can sort both integers and characters
in either ascending or descending order.

The program:

1. Prompts the user to input 10 integers and 10 letters.
2. Displays the entered numbers and letters in their original order.
3. Asks whether the user wants to sort the data ascending or descending.
4. Uses function pointers to call different comparison functions for sorting order.
5. Displays the sorted results for both numbers and letters.

Features:

- Uses function pointers for flexible sorting (ascending or descending).
- Sorts both integers and characters using the bubble sort algorithm.
- Demonstrates modular programming with separate functions for:
  - Sorting (bubblesort and bubblesort2)
  - Swapping (swap and swap2)
  - Comparison (ascending, descending, ascending2, descending2)
- Clears the screen between inputs for a cleaner interface.

Concepts Demonstrated:

- Function pointers in C
- Bubble sort algorithm
- Array manipulation
- Modular programming
- User input/output handling
